    "t1_s1.7": `SYMPOSIUM: Structural Changes in Materials at Normal and Extreme Conditions: A Symposium in Honor of the 70th Birthday of Prof. Valery Levitas
ORGANIZERS: Ashraf Bastawros, Kasra Momeni <kmomeni@ua.edu>, Liming Xiong <lxiong3@ncsu.edu>
This symposium honors Prof. Valery Levitas’ seminal contributions to the mechanics and physics of structural changes in materials, spanning phase transformations, inelasticity, and coupled multi-physics phenomena across length and time scales. The session will bring together researchers working on fundamental mechanisms and predictive frameworks for structural evolution in solids, including (but not limited to) solid–solid and martensitic transformations, pressure- and stress-induced phase transitions, chemical reactions, amorphization, defect-mediated plasticity (dislocations, twinning), damage and failure, and microstructure/grain-structure evolution.

A central theme is the integration of mechanical, physical, and mathematical perspectives—linking atomistic mechanisms to mesoscale evolution and macroscale response—under both ambient and extreme conditions. Contributions are especially encouraged that leverage high-pressure/high-temperature platforms (e.g., diamond anvil cell experiments, large-volume press, shock/ramp compression) and in situ/operando characterization (e.g., synchrotron X-ray diffraction/imaging, spectroscopy, electron microscopy) to resolve transformation pathways and kinetics. We also welcome emerging data-driven approaches, including high-throughput experimentation and simulation, materials informatics, machine-learning-assisted constitutive modeling, physics-informed ML, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation/digital twins that accelerate discovery and improve predictive capability.

Experimental, analytical, computational, and hybrid (physics + data) studies, as well as applications to materials under severe deformation or extreme environments, are all within scope.`,

ORGANIZERS: Brian Cox, franck vernery, christian peco, Md Tahir Saif
We seek papers that explore how relatively simple mechanisms and rules governing discrete active agents can give rise to complex and sometimes surprising emergent behavior in large populations.
Rules and their underlying mechanisms that are relevant to the symposium are broad in nature, including but not limited to those based on chemical factors, on agent motions and mechanics, or on electrical fields.
Agents capable of emergent behavior span a wide variety of length and time scales, from molecules (e.g., self-organization in the cytoskeleton) to living cells (e.g., morphogenesis in epithelial tissues or biofilms) to macroscopic systems (e.g., swarming insects, birds, fish, or robot swarms).
We welcome contributions that explore the problem of discovering useful rules for agents through theoretical approaches (e.g., simulations and/or analytical methods) or through the acquisition and/or analysis of experimental data.
Of interest but not limiting are:
•	The use of AI to extract agent rules from complex data for biological or synthesised populations.
•	Demonstrations of universality between rules that might govern different systems.
•	Any system in which rules can be manipulated to optimize population-scale outcomes, as in robots or synthetic molecular systems but perhaps even in living systems.`,

    "t2_s2.2": `SYMPOSIUM: Biomechanics and Biomimetics Across Time and Length Scales
ORGANIZERS: Ottman Tertuliano, Claire Acevedo, Hortense Le Ferrand, Callan Luetkemeyer
Tissues are inherently hierarchical, complex living structures. Their constituents assemble purposefully starting from the nanoscale to design macroscopically functional organs while simultaneously imbuing the tissues with nonlinear, anisotropic, and classically disparate mechanical properties. Biomimetic composites inspired by natural tissues reproduce the complexity in organisation, composition, and properties. In both natural and synthetic systems,  hierarchical organisation leads to complex, multilevel and dynamic mechanical responses that leverage the dynamic reciprocity between structural interfaces, water, and cell mechanobiology. 


The goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers with expertise in theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to quantitatively investigate how hierarchical structure fundamentally couples to mechanical properties in tissue and bioinspired composites. The symposium will also cover how this coupling in structure-properties dictates the functions of the systems across length and time scales, and elucidate the specific microstructural and biological designs required to attain targeted performance.


Because these systems are anisotropic and nonlinear, they give rise to heterogeneous deformations, novel functions, and simultaneously necessitate novel, information-rich full-field characterization methods. This symposium solicits contributions in all fields related to the mechanics of tissues, hierarchical composites, and novel full-field (i.e., image-based) mechanics across length and time scales. Topics include, but are not limited to:


(a) fracture, damage or rupture nucleation/initiation in tissues and hierarchical composites
(b) bridging time or length scales in tissue mechanical properties
(c) fabrication and design of complex microstructural composites inspired from tissues
(d) testing set-ups and characterisation of bioinspired hierarchical composites
(e) mechanisms of tissue repair and regeneration, aging, and morphogenesis
(f) cellular and function impairment in healthy versus diseased tissues
(g) how cells affect tissue properties over length and time scales
(h) mechanics of musculoskeletal tissues, bone, tendon, muscles, joint, spine, etc. 
(i) mechanical inference of microstructure


Contributions to novel modeling approaches and experimental techniques (including imaging) are particularly welcome.`,

    "t2_s2.3": `SYMPOSIUM: Structure and Mechanics of Living and Bioinspired Materials
ORGANIZERS: Jingjie Yeo, Si Chen, Tian Li, Zhao Qin, Teng Zhang
This symposium explores the current status and future research directions in living and bioinspired materials. Living materials represent an emerging class of natural or engineered composites comprising organisms or cells (e.g., archaea, bacteria, fungi, animal cells, plant cells) integrated with self-produced or artificial scaffolds (e.g., polymers, proteins, polysaccharides). These materials exhibit dynamic environmental responsiveness and "living" characteristics such as self-healing and self-regeneration, enabling properties that emerge distinctly from their constituent components. Concurrently, research on bioinspired materials seeks to emulate the efficiency, sustainability, and innovative strategies inherent in natural biological structures, processes, and functions.

Advancing living and bioinspired materials toward functional devices requires integrated theoretical, computational, data-driven, and experimental approaches. This symposium will examine the current state of the art, emphasizing progress in fundamental properties, process development, manufacturing scalability, and device integration. By convening international researchers from engineering mechanics, biophysics, biochemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science and engineering, the symposium facilitates knowledge exchange and discussion of cutting-edge methods and applications at the intersection of materials science, synthetic biology, and engineering design.

Topics of interest include:
•	Experimental, theoretical, computational, and data-driven modeling, design, and characterization of living and bioinspired materials across molecular, cellular, mesoscopic, and continuum scales  
•	Applications to the design of structures, parts, and devices incorporating living or bioinspired materials
•	Synthesis, manufacturing, and growth of living and bioinspired materials for scalable and sustainably viable applications
•	Theoretical, numerical, and experimental methods for understanding and predicting the structure and mechanics of living and bioinspired materials
•	Generative artificial intelligence methods for inverse design and discovery of functional living materials`,

    "t2_s2.4": `SYMPOSIUM: Mechanically engineered biological fate, form, and function (F3)
ORGANIZERS: Yue Liu, Xin Tang, Dennis Discher
Mechanical driving forces fundamentally contribute to biological systems via a myriad of mechano-chemical-genetic pathways and ultimately regulate their fate, form, and function (F3). For example, mechanical forces can mediate gene expression through mechanotransduction, orchestrate morphogenesis-associated development, and define tissue-tissue/tissue-matrix interactions. 

This mini-symposium aims to explore the mechanical approaches that modulate biological organisms for both mechanistic studies and applicational purposes. We welcome multidisciplinary investigations that elucidate the bridging principles underlying biochemical signals, cytoskeletal dynamics, cellular activities, multicellular architecture, tissue mechanics, organ health, and exogeneous mechanical cues. Engineering modalities developed for high-precision biomechanical modulation and/or mechanomedical technologies will also be highlighted. 

Topics of Interests:
●	Theoretical, computational, and experimental studies that target multiscale interactions between microenvironmental mechanics and biological systems.
●	Emerging cellular behavior and organization derived from intercellular, tissue-tissue, and matrix mediated mechanical crosstalk.
●	Engineering of cellular and tissue activities via state-of-the-art mechanical tools and technologies. 
●	Biomechanical modulation of cell, tissue, or organ functionalization with potential mechanomedical applications in disease therapy.`,

    "t2_s2.5": `SYMPOSIUM: Cell Mechanics and Mechanobiology
ORGANIZERS: Shiva Rudraraju, Christian Franck, Jacob Notbohm, Johannes Weickenmeier, Harshavardhan Kalathur
The mechanical response of biological cells and cell-scale structures is central to understanding their development, functioning, interactions, influence on physiology and related disease conditions. There is an increased awareness and appreciation of the mechanical and mechanobiological underpinnings of various biological phenomena like evolution of biomembranes, cytoskeletal dynamics, embryogenesis, cell division, collective cell motion, cell packing in tissues and tumors, wound healing, role in tissue formation and regeneration, to name a few.  Given the invariable complexity (multi-scale, multi-physics, and multi-phase) of these phenomena, one often needs advanced theoretical, experimental and computational techniques for modeling the underlying movement, mechanics, mechano-chemistry, phase evolution and configurational change processes.  The goal of this minisymposium is to foster a vibrant discussion on experimental techniques and results, mathematical models, numerical methods, and computational simulations to study mechanics and mechanobiology in biological cells and cell-scale structures. The scope of the phenomena being modeled or investigated can range from intra-cell to single cell and cell aggregates.`,

    "t2_s2.6": `SYMPOSIUM: Experimental and Computational Methods in Mechanobiology and Biomaterial Innovation
ORGANIZERS: Hanxun Jin, Farid Alisafaei, Grace Gu, Guy M. Genin
A new paradigm is emerging in mechanobiology and biomaterials: designing materials from the molecular scale upward by understanding how hierarchical structures link atomistic-scale chemistry to functional mechanical performance. This mini-symposium will convene researchers at the forefront of developing and integrating experimental, computational, and hybrid methodologies to understand, model, and engineer mechanobiological systems and bio-inspired materials across all relevant length scales.

Mechanobiology and biomaterials research is rapidly evolving as advances in high-resolution mechanical measurements, bio-fabrication, and data-driven modeling enable quantitative interrogation of cell-extracellular matrix (cell-ECM) interactions across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. Modern experimental mechanics now allows direct measurement of cell-generated forces, ECM viscoelasticity, nonlinear deformation, damage, and remodeling, providing new insight into mechanically driven pathologies such as fibrosis, cardiovascular remodeling, cancer progression, and impaired tissue regeneration.

Concurrently, innovations in engineered hydrogels, fibrous ECM-mimetic networks, architected biomaterials, and bio-printed tissues have expanded the design space of mechanically functional cellular microenvironments, demanding rigorous frameworks to link ECM microstructure, mechanics, and cell response. In parallel, constitutive modeling, multiphysics simulations, and scientific machine learning are enabling mechanism-aware parameter identification, inverse design, and predictive modeling of coupled cell-ECM systems.

Topics of interest:
• Integrated experimental-computational methodologies: Coupled frameworks that combine mechanics-based experimentation with biologically informed modeling and data-driven inference to enable molecular-to-functional design pipelines for therapeutic biomaterials.
• Multi-scale modeling and simulation: Approaches spanning atomistic to continuum scales, including DFT, molecular dynamics, coarse-grained models, and finite element methods, for modeling of nonlinear, viscoelastic, damage, and remodeling behaviors in biological tissues and multiphysics simulation of coupled cell-ECM systems. 
• AI/ML-driven materials design: Scientific machine learning and physics-informed approaches for parameter identification, surrogate modeling, inverse design of biomaterials with targeted mechanical properties, and data-driven discovery of structure-property-function relationships. 
• Experimental mechanics and fabrication: High-resolution characterization of cellular force generation, adhesion, traction, and matrix remodeling, alongside additive manufacturing and 3D printing strategies for hierarchical, bio-inspired structures and ECM-mimetic biomaterials. 
• Disease mechanobiology: Mechanistic understanding of fibrosis, cancer, cardiovascular remodeling, and tissue degeneration driven by altered cell-ECM interactions and hierarchical structural changes in pathological tissues.`,

    "t2_s2.7": `SYMPOSIUM: Biomechanics of Morphogenesis
ORGANIZERS: Daniel Szymanski, Thomas Siegmund
Forces within, between, and among cells drive morphogenesis. Tensile and shear forces are also sensed by cells. Force sensing allows cells, tissues, and organs to continuously adjust their physical properties and generate predictable morphological outputs. This session will include research that uses computational and experimental approaches to define the key forces and sensing mechanisms that operate during growth and development .`,

    "t2_s2.8": `SYMPOSIUM: From Nerves to Nanomaterials: Mechanics of Super Soft Porous Materials
ORGANIZERS: Arina Korneva
This mini symposium will bring together scientists who are pioneering theoretical, experimental, computational, and imaging methods to discover the mechanics of super soft fluid-saturated porous materials. These materials encompass materials in invertebrates such as medusae, marine sponges, and the like; vertebrate nerves, brain, and cartilage, and in synthetic hydrogels and nanoporous materials. While these materials appear across nature and engineering, they exhibit similar emerging mechanical behaviors, which we’ve only scratched the surface of. This symposium will share new developments in mechanics of soft porous media and new ideas for pushing forward this emerging field.

Application 1: Porous soft biological materials. This symposium will bring together new ideas in mechanics to aid in understanding the roles of fluid in our nerves: the optic nerve responsible for vision, peripheral nerves responsible for sensing, and motor nerves responsible for movement. The status quo in nerves has been that fluid is needed for nutrient support and electrical signaling. A decade ago, a new role for fluid flow was discovered in the brain- to clear toxins during sleep. Engineering mechanics has been used to advance our understanding of this phenomenon in the brain and is now emerging for other nerves which have different micro- and nano-structures. Nerves are also complex materials because they are comprised of many different types of polymers, solutes, gases, ions, and fluids. Recently, engineering mechanics principles were used to propose that fluid can shield cells inside nerves from injury. In another group, engineering mechanics was used to model the change in fluid pressure in the nerve during various physiological conditions. However, the flow of fluid in the nano-pores and micro-pores in various nerves is a new topic with implications for broad applications in biology and medicine. 

Application 2: Natural and Engineered Soft Porous Nanomaterials. This symposium will serve as a platform to develop new ideas for studying poromechanics of innovative nanomaterials: nanofibrous membranes from synthetic nanofibers or biological fibers (i.e. actin), soft porous crystalline materials, Metal-Organic Frameworks. Nanofibrous membranes can swell to absorb various solvents or filter solutes. Newly engineered Metal-Organic Frameworks can change their structure or undergo phase transitions upon interaction with fluids, like many novel hydrogels. These emerging materials are actively studied by materials scientists and chemical engineers, but there is a lack of understanding their mechanical properties and the means to control their mechanical behavior in different environments. The goal of this symposium is to identify the common ground between the novel theoretical and computational models of these materials. As a bonus, these models will open up new avenues in modeling other soft materials.

Application 3: Advanced experimentation and imaging of fluid-solid interactions in porous materials. Experiments with super soft materials are extremely challenging, and sometimes their synthesis or isolation is limited to minuscule amounts. Furthermore, their complex behavior (swelling/deswelling, electric properties, solute transport, self-actuation of forces, etc.) does not have a defined methodology for characterization. The pore structure is between nano- to micron-scale, requiring the development of advanced image-based characterization techniques. This symposium will gather experts in the field and discuss new ideas for evaluating the emerging mechanics of these materials and structures. We will welcome experts in advanced optics, acoustics, X-ray imaging, MRI, and developers of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). These experts are invited to the mini-symposium to share novel techniques for discovering novel phenomena of soft porous materials.`,

    "t3_s3.1": `SYMPOSIUM: Composites R&D and Education Using Generative AI and LLM
ORGANIZERS: Wenbin Yu, Dianyun Zhang
Composites R&D is entering a transformative era as generative AI and large language models (LLMs) begin to reshape how we design, analyze, manufacture, certify, and teach composite structures and materials. This symposium on “AI-Powered Composites R&D and Education” brings together researchers, practitioners, software developers, and educators who are leveraging these emerging tools to accelerate innovation, democratize expertise, and rethink traditional workflows across the composites value chain.

The symposium will highlight how LLMs, multimodal models, and agentic AI systems can augment or couple with physics-based methods—such as micromechanics, multiscale modeling, progressive damage, and structural optimization—to generate smarter design spaces, automate routine tasks, and support high-quality decision-making. Topics of interest include AI-assisted material and layup selection, generative design of laminates and architected materials, automated pre- and post-processing for FEA, intelligent workflows for certification-by-analysis, and integration of AI with digital twins for real-time monitoring and life prediction of composite components.

A key focus of the symposium is knowledge engineering for composites. We invite contributions on building domain-specific knowledge graphs, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) systems, and specialized copilots that consolidate the fragmented knowledge of design guidelines, standards, best practices, failure databases, and historical test programs. Of particular interest are approaches that embed mechanics-based constraints into AI systems, ensure traceability of reasoning and sources, and support robust verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification.

The symposium also emphasizes education and workforce development. Generative AI is rapidly changing how students learn design, analysis, manufacturing, and testing of composites as well as how they document and communicate engineering decisions. We welcome case studies on AI-enabled learning modules, virtual teaching assistants, interactive design studios, and simulation-driven labs where LLMs guide students through problem framing, model setup, interpretation of results, and reflection on assumptions. Discussions on academic integrity, assessment strategies, and how to teach students to collaborate responsibly with AI tools are especially encouraged.

Submissions may address, but are not limited to: AI-augmented composites design and optimization; physics-informed and hybrid ML–mechanics workflows; automated code and script generation for composites software; natural-language interfaces to legacy tools; AI-assisted experimental planning and data reduction; interpretable and trustworthy AI for safety-critical structures; and frameworks for benchmarking and governing AI use in industrial and regulatory contexts. Contributions that include open-source tools, benchmark datasets, and reproducible workflows are particularly welcome.

In addition to technical presentations, the symposium aims to foster dialogue on standards, ethics, and future directions: What new skills will composite engineers need in an AI-rich environment? How do we ensure that generative models respect physical laws and domain constraints? What are effective patterns for human-in-the-loop oversight in design, analysis, and education?

ORGANIZERS: Hamed Hatami-Marbini, MATTHEW GRASINGER, CATALIN PICU
An interconnected network of fibers forms the solid skeleton of many biological and non-biological materials such as the extracellular matrix of soft tissues, cytoskeleton, and various types of non-wovens, which are collectively referred to as network materials. The macroscopic behavior of these materials results from a combination of factors, including the intrinsic properties of their individual constituents, the details of their architecture, and the interactions that occur between fibers. Identifying the relationship between structure and function is crucial not only for interpreting the unique behavior of biological fibrous materials but also for guiding the development of engineering network materials with tailored properties and enhanced functionality. A persistent challenge in this field is bridging the gap between experimentally accessible microstructural data and the parameters of detailed, predictive micromechanical and molecular models. 

The objective of this symposium is to provide a forum for sharing recent advances related to the unique properties of network materials. Of special interest are the response of these systems across multiple length scales and the links between mechanical behavior and microstructural characteristics revealed by advanced experimental approaches, discrete level numerical simulations, continuum models informed by the subscales, statistical methods, and multiphysics procedures.

Topics of interest
Experimental and modeling/numerical studies in polymer networks and gels, paper and textile mechanics, non-wovens, tissue mechanics, cells/cytoskeleton, and suspensions rheology are of interest. Specific subjects include, but are not limited to:
•	Multiscale modeling of fiber network material properties; elasticity, poroelasticity, viscoelasticity, damage and fracture,
•	Experimental characterization of natural and biological entangled systems; tissues, cells, and tissue engineering fibrous scaffolds,
•	Integration of experimental measurements with computational models; validation strategies for multiscale models, and inverse methods for inferring fiber-level properties from macroscopic response,
•	Continuum-level micromechanical modeling, statistical homogenization, graph theory-based network analysis, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics approaches,

    "t3_s3.3": `SYMPOSIUM: Mechanics-driven design and manufacturing for metamaterials and soft actuators
ORGANIZERS: Craig Michael Hamel, Connor Armstrong, Shuai Wu, Shaoting Lin, Liwei Wang
Recent advances in additive manufacturing, such as direct ink writing and digital light processing, enable high-precision placement of materials with different functionalities. This ability opens a large design space for multifunctional composites, mechanical metamaterials, and soft actuator devices. For largely linear design goals, existing computational approaches ranging from topology optimization to more recent AI/ML approaches are well documented, and their manufacturing is straightforward. However, these approaches become limited when extreme nonlinearities arise from large deformation, self-contact, and inherent material dissipation (e.g. plasticity and viscoelasticity) in soft materials and structures, as well as from multiphysics or multi-objective design requirements.
In this mini symposium, we are soliciting presentations revolving around the broad topics of mechanics-driven design and manufacturing for metamaterials and soft actuator devices with nonlinear and exotic mechanical behaviors such as buckling, snap-through, and multiphysics responses. We are particularly interested in presentations focusing on the cross-section of mechanics-based modeling and inverse design methods that explicitly incorporate constituent material design and manufacturing considerations. Examples of such presentations could include “how to tune LCE resin formulations for improved fatigue in cycled lattice compression”, or “how to optimize mechanical metamaterial stiffness functionalization using generative AI”.
Representative topics of interest:
•	Generative AI for nonlinear metamaterials and soft matter design
•	Co-design of materials, structures, and manufacturing processes
•	Optimization methods for responsive materials
•	Active metamaterials under large deformation
•	Tunable mechanical, acoustic, and electromagnetic responses via large deformation`,

ORGANIZERS: Sameh Tawfick, Ioannis Chasiotis, Xin Ning
There is an increasing need for higher performance, multi-functional and load-bearing space structures that can endure the harsh space environment. Space structures have historically relied on deployable design concepts to adhere to the limitations set by launch vehicles, which is typically smaller than the size needed to accomplish the mission requirements. In addition to deploying pre-built, packaged, or folded space structures, future missions will rely on In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM). ISAM enables manufacturing, operation and repair, of space vehicles and structures over the entire lifespan of the mission. ISAM could enable future missions ranging from building the next international space station to enabling space solar power beaming and on-orbit data centers. 
Mechanics of materials and structures, particularly in the presence of the extreme space conditions and limited accessibility, plays a critical role for deployable structures and in-space manufacturing. This mini-symposium calls for abstracts in topics relevant for space applications:
-	In space manufacturing of composite materials and structures 
-	3D printing and additive manufacturing for space and in space
-	Optimization, Modeling and simulations of morphing and deployable structures
-	Origami, Kirigami, and metamaterials for space applications
-	Multifunctional, intelligent, and strain sensing structures
-	Nonlinear elasticity, buckling, and dynamics of morphing and deployable structures
-	Materials development and characterization for space environments.
-	Experimental and modeling studies of material and structural damage due to Atomic Oxygen (AO), VUV, solar radiation, and space debris impact.`,

ORGANIZERS: Carlos M. Portela, Lucas Meza, David Restrepo, Tian Chen, Christelle Combescure
Architected materials combine topology and mesoscale morphological features to achieve exotic multi-physical properties that are unattainable by traditional monolithic solids. In addition to designing for mechanics, modern architected materials exhibit novel characteristics in acoustics, thermal, electromagnetic, and other domains. Architected material systems such as periodic/aperiodic cellular solids, origami and kirigami-based architectures, contact or entanglement-dominated responses, and multi-phase composites, have the potential to transform the way modern engineering structures are designed and manufactured. Recent realizations of architected materials, aided by new characterization techniques, design algorithms, and computational methods, have shed light on exciting and previously unexplored realms of their mechanical response. For instance, their ‘dynamic’ responses—i.e., time- or stimuli-dependent properties—present exciting directions for a variety of applications. Recent realizations of stimuli-responsive architected materials—via magnetic, electrical, optical, or thermal fields—have demonstrated the potential to endow architected materials with on-demand responses.

Physical entanglements and loops, whereby two or more slender members are wound around one another, provide a dynamic alternative to chemical bonds for cohering networked materials and tuning their multiphysical properties. Entanglements have become of great interest to researchers due to their impact on the mechanics of networks, including polymers, smart textiles, metamaterials and more. In polymers, entanglements and slide rings enable new modes of energy dissipation and can be used to significantly enhance mechanical toughness.

    "t4_s4.5": `SYMPOSIUM: Photomechanical and Electromechanical Behaviors in Ceramics, Semiconductors and Metals
ORGANIZERS: Qi An, Lin Li, Yu Zou, Xinghang Zhang
Photomechanical and electromechanical phenomena couple optical or electrical stimuli to a material’s mechanical response. Photomechanical materials produce stress and mechanical work when illuminated, while electromechanical coupling, e.g. piezoelectricity or current-induced deformation, links electric fields or currents to strain or plasticity. These couplings are increasingly recognized as powerful mechanisms for tuning mechanical behavior in ceramics, semiconductors and metals. Recent discoveries reveal the breadth and significance of these effects. In ceramics and wide-bandgap semiconductors, illumination can dramatically alter mechanical behavior via carrier–defect interactions. For example, moderate blue/UV light has been shown to increase the elastic stiffness of ZnO by over 40%. Photoexcitation in ZnS suppresses dislocation glide and reduces plasticity, whereas n-type doping or applied bias can enhance dislocation motion. In metals, DC electric fields or currents are known to lower the flow stress and enhance ductility, known as the electroplastic effect. Collectively, these findings indicate that electric charges and light can fundamentally modify bonding, defect mobility, and elastic response in crystalline solids.

This symposium will highlight recent advances in understanding photomechanical and electromechanical behaviors in ceramics, semiconductors and metals. We invite contributions spanning experiment, theory, and computation that address how light and electric fields interact with microstructure and defects to change mechanical properties. Special emphasis will be placed on fundamental mechanisms, such as charge-driven dislocation dynamics, strain-modulated band structure, light/field-driven phase transformations, as well as emerging techniques (e.g. in situ optical nanoindentation, ultrafast strain probes, multiscale modeling and machine learning). Topics include both basic science and the development of new opto-electro-mechanical materials and devices, aiming to advance the field of ceramics, semiconductors and metal that exploit opto-electro-mechanical coupling.

•	Photoplasticity and photoelasticity in ceramics and inorganic semiconductors: light-induced changes in strength, ductility, and elastic moduli mediated by carriers and defects.
•	Electroplasticity and electromechanical coupling: electric-field or current-driven plastic deformation in metals and piezoelectric/flexoelectric responses in semiconductors and ceramics.
•	Mechanical behavior and defects in ceramics: Fundamental and applied studies on the mechanical response of ceramics, including elasticity, plasticity, fracture, creep, and fatigue under mechanical, thermal, electrical, or optical stimuli.

    "t4_s4.9": `SYMPOSIUM: Mechanics and Dynamics of Soft Electrochemically Active Materials
ORGANIZERS: Xiaokang Wang, Royal Ihuaenyi, Xixian Yang, Siddharth Doshi
Soft electrochemically active materials—such as organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), radical polymers, redox-active hydrogels, and electrochemically active polymer composites—offer a rare combination of electrochemical functionality and mechanical compliance. This combination underpins emerging technologies including stretchable and wearable electronics, bioelectronic interfaces, organic electrochemical devices and transistors, soft robotics and actuators, and mechanically conformable energy-storage systems. 

In these platforms, mechanics is not merely a reliability constraint; it actively governs transport pathways, morphological stability, and interfacial integrity, thereby shaping device performance, failure modes, and lifetime. For example, repeated ion/solvent insertion and extraction drives cyclic swelling and stress evolution that can produce fatigue; in film–substrate architectures, swelling-induced strain mismatch can trigger film cracking and delamination; and in stretchable systems, sustained deformation can cause creep and stress relaxation that translate into performance drift.

A central challenge is that electrochemical transport, electrostatic interactions, phase/morphology evolution, and mechanical response are strongly coupled across molecular-to-device length scales and nanoseconds-to-hours timescales, while the effective mechanical properties evolve dynamically during operation. Resolving this coupled, time-evolving chemo–electro–mechanical response is essential to (i) establish mechanistic understanding of degradation and failure, (ii) construct predictive, design-relevant constitutive and reduced-order models, and (iii) guide mechanics-oriented material, device, and interface design. Progress increasingly depends on in-situ/operando multimodal characterization (imaging, scattering/spectroscopy, electrochemical diagnostics, and mechanical measurements), multiscale modeling, and AI/ML methods for multimodal data fusion, inverse parameter identification, and accelerated simulation/design.

This symposium will bring together researchers spanning mechanics of materials theory, characterization, device physics, and computational modeling to discuss emerging understanding and open problems in the mechanics and dynamics of soft electrochemically active materials, with emphasis on AI/ML as a unifying toolkit. Topics include operando mechanical characterization; chemo–electro–mechanical coupling and interfacial mechanics; multiscale and reduced-order modeling; mechanics in applications including soft robotics, optoelectronics, and organic electrochemical transistors; and AI-guided design of materials, interfaces, and devices with uncertainty-aware prediction. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue, the symposium aims to advance fundamental understanding and accelerate the development of mechanically robust soft electrochemically active materials and systems for next-generation applications.`,

ORGANIZERS: Brandon Runnels, Monique McClain
Energetic materials (EMs), such as propellants and explosives, exhibit a broad spectrum of mechanical behavior at a range of length scales, and time scales ranging from years to nanoseconds. Performances of energetics can often be traced to their mechanical response during manufacturing, aging, and mechanical or thermal loading, but the mechanics of many key EMs are still relatively poorly understood.
This minisymposium brings together researchers in EMs with a specific focus on the modeling, simulation, and experimental characterization of EM mechanics. Specific topics of interest in this minisymposium include:
Damage modeling and characterization at both low and high strain rates, ranging from aging to detonation, and including such mechanisms as plasticity, viscoelasticity, fracture, and fatigue.

ORGANIZERS: Lucia Stein-Montalvo, Fani Derveni
Controllable instabilities and nonlinear deformations in slender and compliant structures offer powerful opportunities for engineering applications, ranging from stretchable electronics and surgical robotics devices to energy-absorbing, load-redistributing components and lightweight civil, architectural, and aerospace systems.
Despite their strong potential in the built environment and emerging frontiers such as large-scale deployable and adaptive structural systems, infrastructure resilience, and space structures, the majority of research in this area remains focused on millimeter- and centimeter-scale systems, where idealized behavior and controlled boundary conditions are often easier to achieve. 
Bridging these concepts across scales requires new mechanical insights that account for increased imperfection sensitivity, geometric and material nonlinearities, stochastic variability, multiphysics coupling, and scale-dependent load paths. Addressing these challenges demands a range of complementary approaches, including experiments, nonlinear theory, high-fidelity numerical simulations, reduced-order modeling, and data-driven methods.
The goal of this mini-symposium is to bring together researchers working on instabilities and nonlinear mechanics across length scales to identify unifying mechanical principles, share advances in scale-bridging methodologies, and foster cross-fertilization between communities studying small-scale systems and full-scale structural applications.

ORGANIZERS: Mingchao Liu, Yunlan Zhang, Jie Yin, Damiano Pasini, Petro M. Reis
Mechanical instabilities—such as buckling, snap-through, and wrinkling—have traditionally been regarded as undesirable failure modes that limit structural performance. Increasingly, however, these phenomena are being harnessed as powerful design principles for achieving novel and enhanced functionalities in materials, structures, and systems across multiple length scales, including morphing matter, mechanical metamaterials, soft robots, deployable and energy-absorbing devices, and bio-inspired systems.

    "t5_s5.7": `SYMPOSIUM: Mechanics of damage, fracture and friction in materials across scales
ORGANIZERS: Ahmed Elbanna, David Kammer, John Kolinski, Krishnaswamy Ravi-Chandar
Catastrophic failure of materials is a highly complex and nonlinear process with various distinct phases. Initially, nucleation is often a slow mechanism that is sensitive to disorder in the material structure. Once these small-scale perturbations become critical, failure is driven by fracture propagation, which is a dynamic multiscale phenomenon. Understanding the underpinnings of material response at the microscale and their implications for fracture at macro scale is thus of vital importance to many engineering, biological, and geophysical applications.

This symposium solicits contributions in all fields related to multiscale physics of damage, fracture and friction in (quasi-)brittle solids and soft materials. Possible topics may include, but are not limited to, theoretical analysis, experimental measurements, and computational modeling of:

fracture nucleation/initiation in disordered systems (materials, interfaces, structures),
crack propagation through heterogeneous materials and structures (crack speed, path selection, …)
rupture arrest in non-uniform and structured systems (arrest criterion, …)

ORGANIZERS: Ken Kamrin, David Henann, Ryan Hurley, Marcial Gonzalez, Carl Wassgren, Paul Mort, Adyota Gupta
Granular materials, such as those arising in industry and geophysics, display a variety of unique phenomena, such as evolving volume compaction/dilatation, localized shear-banding, fabric evolution, grain breakage, particle shape effects, rate-and-pressure-sensitive rheological behavior, segregation, and pore-fluid interactions. The varied behavior of granular materials at the macroscopic, continuum scale stems from the rich physics at the microstructural scale; however, understanding the underlying microscale mechanics and physics and the connections between the particle and continuum scales remain unresolved issues of current research. Experiments, theory, and (particle and continuum) modeling aimed at a deeper understanding of granular materials are necessary for improving modeling for large-scale systems comprised of billions of grains. This symposium shall focus on the current state-of-the-art of research in the mechanics and physics of granular materials at length-scales ranging from the particle level to the continuum scale.

    "t6_s6.2": `SYMPOSIUM: Dynamics, instabilities, and singularities in free surface flows
ORGANIZERS: Osman Basaran, Hansol Wee, Ajay Kumar, Naresh Dhanwani
Free surface flows with hydrodynamic singularities are legion in science and engineering. Such hydrodynamic singularities arise in situations where liquid drops and jets, bubbles, and liquid films break or pinch-off or rupture, others where drops and bubbles coalesce or merge, when a liquid drop impacts a cold or a hot solid surface, and during thin film coating flows where there are dynamic or moving contact lines. Hydrodynamic singularities are challenging to study because they involve flows where the intrinsic time and length scales may differ by at least six or more orders of magnitude (Eggers, Rev. Mod. Phys., 1997; Eggers and Villermaux, Rep. Prog. Phys., 2008; Anthony et al., Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., 2023). Free surface flows with singularities arise in applications as diverse as ink jet printing, drop-by-drop manufacturing, spraying and atomization (e.g. in crop spraying and spray coating and painting), chemical separations, and sintering. The goal of the mini symposium is to bring researchers from numerous disciplines (engineering, physics, and mathematics) to summarize the state-of-the art and help define possible avenues of future research in the field.`,

    "t6_s6.3": `SYMPOSIUM: Electrohydrodynamics
ORGANIZERS: Osman Basaran (and Petia Vlahovska---see below), Petia Vlahovska, Ajay Kumar, Hansol Wee
The birth of the field of electrohydrodynamics (EHD) can be traced to the seminal papers by Lord Rayleigh (Phil. Mag., 1882) on the instability of charged drops and G. I. Taylor (Proc. Roy. Soc. London, 1964) on the instability of drops and formation of conical tips caused by an applied electric field. The field came to its own after Taylor (1966) and Melcher (1965/6) independently discovered the thereto unknown and hence unexpected role of electrical shear stresses in the dynamics of liquid drops and films, and Melcher and Taylor joined forces to publish their now celebrated review article on EHD that introduced the concept of a leaky dielectric or semi insulating fluid to the scientific community (Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., 1969). While the field was initially purely driven by fundamental questions arising in physics and atmospheric sciences (especially cloud physics), both scientific challenges and new applications worked in tandem to generate further interest in the field. Since the 1970s, desalting, emulsification, and dehydration of crude oil by the application of an electric field and the use of electric fields in ink jet printing helped to further popularize the field. In 1992, J. B. Fenn of Yale University was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of using electric fields in the now widely used analytical technique known as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS). Recent areas of intense research activity have included electrospinning and drop-by-drop processing. The significance of EHD to fluid mechanics is made evident by the publication roughly every ten years of an authoritative review article in the Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. (e.g. Saville, 1997, and Vlahovska, 2019). Recent research in the field have been focused on various instabilities and breakup dynamics exhibited by prolate but more significantly by oblate drops, vesicles, and drop-drop interactions. Some challenges and unsolved problems in the field include theoretical analysis of situations where the leaky dielectric model is inadequate and the use of electric fields to create organized as well as disorganized structures far from equilibrium. The goal of the mini symposium is to bring researchers from numerous disciplines (engineering, physics, analytical chemistry, and mathematics) to summarize the state-of-the art and help define possible avenues of future theoretical, computational, and experimental research in the field.`,

    "t6_s6.4": `SYMPOSIUM: Soft hydraulics: Low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics and fluid-structure interactions
ORGANIZERS: Ivan C. Christov, Shrihari D. Pande
Soft hydraulics addresses the coupled dynamics of fluid flow and compliant conduit deformation, where pressure forces deform elastic walls, which in turn modify the flow. This bidirectional feedback requires extending the classical understanding of hydraulics. New questions arise: What is Poiseuille's law for a non-Newtonian fluid in a compliant microchannel? What is Womersley's law for a viscoelastic fluid in an elastic tube? At the same time, answering these questions is essential for designing soft robotics actuators, building lab-on-a-chip and biomicrofluidic systems, and unravelling the connections between physiological flows and disease conditions.

The key challenge of advancing soft hydraulics lies in the interplay between fluid rheology and wall mechanics. A deep understanding of each is required to develop predictive theories.  Experimentally, it is also difficult to isolate these coupled phenomena, as, for example, the pressure drop in a channel is reduced by both elastic expansion and shear-thinning effects. Additional complexities may also arise, such as electro-osmotic and diffusio-osmotic flows in microfluidic systems, as well as the presence of large, small, and deformable particles in the flow. Surface-driven flows can generate internal pressure distributions that trigger fluid-structure instabilities. Similarly, external pressurization can cause channel collapse under certain flow conditions. Worse, channels made from soft materials may fail under the hydrodynamic loading within.

Progress in this field requires understanding these coupled physics. This symposium seeks contributions spanning theory, simulation, and experiment that advance either our fundamental understanding of soft hydraulics or its applications.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-- Flow rate–pressure drop relations and hydraulic impedance in deformable systems

    "t7_s7.3": `SYMPOSIUM: Symmetry in mechanics
ORGANIZERS: Ivan C. Christov, Md Mahmudur Rahman
Symmetry is a cornerstone of theoretical physics and continuum mechanics. It casts governing laws in geometric form and, through invariance, yields conservation principles. Building on Noether’s seminal link between symmetries and conserved quantities, Peierls and Eshelby extended invariance ideas to the mechanics of defects; Gurtin subsequently generalized these concepts to interfaces; and later syntheses by Herrmann and Maugin clarified the broader framework of configurational (material) forces. However, the roles of symmetry and configurational forces remain underutilized in continuum mechanics. In particular, a systematic variational formalism of the configurational forces in fluids is still lacking, and the role of material symmetry in fluid–structure interaction and in flows with fluid–fluid interfaces remains largely unexplored. Addressing these gaps is essential for completing the geometric structure underlying continuum mechanics and for uncovering new conserved quantities and integral balance laws in both elasticity and fluid mechanics.

Symmetry breaking arising from internal structure (e.g., defects, microstructure), or from the topology and geometry of a problem, naturally introduces source terms in otherwise conserved balance laws. In fluid–structure interactions, a central difficulty is describing the kinematics of moving interfaces and formulating the coupled dynamics within a consistent variational framework. Even when such a formulation is available, deriving and interpreting the associated interfacial configurational balances in physically relevant settings remains a significant open challenge.
Unifying the conceptual understanding of configurational forces (including their roles in fluids, solids, and fluid–structure interactions) is a frontier topic in mechanics. To this end, this symposium invites contributions that develop and apply the notion of symmetry of physical laws and configurational-force concepts to problems in mechanics broadly interpreted, including defects, interfaces, and coupled fluid–solid or multiphase dynamics.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-- Geometric and invariant structure of configurational-force balances (material forces)
-- Pseudomomentum and its role in compressible irrotational flows (acoustics)
-- Configurational forces in capillary flows and interfacial transport
-- Variational formulations, relabeling symmetry, and wave momentum
-- Configurational forces and generalized interface kinematics in fracture and crack propagation
-- Conserved quantities and integral balances for slender structures (elastica, plates, and membranes)
-- Applications to fluid–structure interaction, multiphase flows (bubble and droplet dynamics/spreading), and beyond`,

    "t7_s7.9": `SYMPOSIUM: High-Throughput and Rapid Testing
ORGANIZERS: Kawai Kwok, Wen Luo
The mini-symposium on High-Throughput and Rapid Testing provides a forum to discuss concepts and demonstrations on novel testing methods of materials with increased data throughput or accelerated speed. Measuring material properties is a prerequisite for designing new structures and systems or validating new materials. Conventional techniques are inefficient in probing material characteristics under a wide range of conditions, especially for properties that require large datasets or long test durations. This mini-symposium is focused on the unique challenges of generating material property data with cost effective methods. Papers are invited for a wide range of topics including but not limited to failure statistics, viscoelasticity, (visco)plasticity, multifunctional properties.`,

    "t7_s7.10": `SYMPOSIUM: Multimodal Scanning Probe Nano-Metrology via Contact and Non-Contact Mechanics
ORGANIZERS: SungWoo Nam, Mehmet Baykara
The rapid advancement of nanotechnology, quantum materials, and semiconductor manufacturing has amplified the need for robust, high-resolution metrology tools capable of probing electrical, mechanical, optical, and functional properties with unprecedented precision. This symposium aims to bring together researchers developing and applying multimodal atomic force microscopy (AFM)—including conductive AFM (C-AFM), friction force microscopy (FFM), piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM), scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), and related advanced AFM modalities—to highlight emerging capabilities and the foundational mechanics that govern their performance. A central theme of the symposium is the role of contact and non-contact mechanics, which fundamentally determine spatial resolution, signal sensitivity, and quantitative interpretation across AFM techniques. We invite contributions addressing theoretical, computational, and experimental advances that deepen our understanding of tip–sample interactions—from continuum and atomistic modeling of contact forces, adhesion, viscoelasticity, and electro-mechanical coupling, to the optical field that underpins PiFM, s-SNOM, and other near-field probes. The symposium will also showcase applications where multimodal AFM provides unique insights, including characterization of 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Particular interest will be placed on correlative and hybrid approaches—such as integrating/combining electrical (C-AFM), mechanical (FFM), electro-mechanical (PFM), and/or nearfield optical spectroscopy —to extract multidimensional datasets that bridge nanoscale physics with device-level functionality. This symposium will foster cross-disciplinary dialogue aimed at connecting contact and non-contact mechanics communities with multimodal scanning probe microscopy communities to establish fundamentals and quantitative standards, improving reproducibility, and accelerating the adoption of next-generation nano-metrology platforms.

Topics will include:
1. Mechanics of tip–sample contact, near-contact, and non-contact interactions that dictate spatial resolution, force sensitivity, and signal formation across advanced AFM modes.
2. Quantitative multimodal metrology that integrates electrical, mechanical, and optical signals to extract reproducible, physics-based measurements of nanoscale interaction mechanisms.
3. Coupling between confined optical fields and tip–sample mechanics in near-field probes such as PiFM and s-SNOM, linking optical excitation to local electro-mechanical response.
4. Mechanics-informed multimodal AFM applied to emerging optoelectronic and 2D materials to resolve interfacial forces, polarization effects, and structure–property relationships.`,

    "t7_s7.11": `SYMPOSIUM: AI for Advanced Materials and Structures
ORGANIZERS: Marco Maurizi, Dennis Kochmann, Xiaoyu (Rayne) Zheng, Emma Lejeune
Description:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently achieved unprecedented advances, ranging from Nobel Prize–winning breakthroughs in protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold) to large language models (LLMs) transforming natural language processing. In parallel, the understanding, characterization, prediction, design, and discovery of advanced materials and structures—spanning metal–organic frameworks at the atomic scale, metamaterials, cellular solids, and composites at the micro- and meso-scale, up to robotic and adaptive matter at the macroscale—remain fundamentally limited by their astronomically vast design spaces.
AI-driven methods provide powerful new tools to explore these spaces efficiently, dramatically reducing the cost and time associated with physics-based simulations and experimental testing. By enabling data-driven, physics-informed, and hybrid approaches, AI opens the door to the design and discovery of materials and structures with tunable, programmable, and multifunctional properties, unlocking unprecedented mechanical and functional capabilities.
This symposium will bring together researchers working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, advanced materials, and solid and structural mechanics, with the goal of highlighting recent breakthroughs, emerging methodologies, and open challenges in this rapidly evolving field.
